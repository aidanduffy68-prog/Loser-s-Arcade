# Loser-s-Arcade
Loser’s Arcade is a satirical, terminal-style arcade game about crypto gambling, fry cooks, and the art of losing money.
nstead of chasing 100x gains, your goal is to blow up your account of FRY (🍟 in-game currency) before the end of your shift. The twist? The “enemy” isn’t the market—it’s you—while the Wall Street Clanker laughs from across the fryer.

🕹️ Gameplay Loop

Start with 10,000 FRY at the restaurant arcade terminal.

Move around the floor (WASD) to bump into NPCs, pick up burgers, and trigger trading terminals.

Choose trades: Call / Double Down / YOLO.

Watch your stack melt while the AI Clanker roasts you with self-deprecating banter.

Boss battles: Survive escalating market chaos (Black Swan events, FED hikes, random rug pulls).

End goal: Lose it all before the shift ends.

🔥 Features

FRY Coin Economy – play money with no value except emotional damage.

Difficulty Scaling – markets get more chaotic each round.

Replay System – simulate trades like TradingView but dumber.

Arcade Feel – ASCII art graphics, clanky sound effects, leaderboard of who lost the most FRY fastest.

Cathartic Design – built for crypto gamblers who need to learn how to enjoy losing.

📊 Research Angle

Loser’s Arcade isn’t just a joke—it’s also an experiment in:

Gamifying loss tolerance (learning how to lose without panic).

Addiction redirection (safe simulation of risky behaviors).

Market parody mechanics (position malleability, chaos injections, boss battles).
